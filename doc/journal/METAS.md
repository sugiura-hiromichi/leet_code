# Attentions

1. MetaData includes health plans

2. Set Calender of that week based on WEEKLYLOG.md
	- Plans should be manageable

3. WEEKLYLOGs are referencing MONTHLYLOG
	- Plans should be a little challenging one

4. Category classifying must explicitly written in *LOGs.md
	- Category is just a example. Don't be so serious!
	- Category priority is important to make actual progress. Make it visible.
